# Morse Message Encoder - Final Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a complete Morse Code Encoder on the Nexys 4 DDR board. The system bridges the gap between a PC and the physical world by taking text input via UART, encoding it into Morse code, and outputting it through two synchronized channels:
1.  **Audio:** A clean sine-wave tone generated by a custom DDFS (Direct Digital Frequency Synthesis) core.
2.  **Visual:** A synchronized flashing character on the 7-segment display.

**Key Engineering Feature:**
The visual flashing logic was offloaded to hardware. Instead of using software delays (which would interrupt the audio timing), I modified the FPGA hardware driver to handle the blinking autonomously at ~7Hz.

## Key Features
* **UART Integration:** Accepts real-time text input from a serial terminal (Putty/MobaXterm @ 9600 baud).
* **DDFS Audio Engine:** Generates precise 600Hz audio tones (PDM output) rather than simple square waves.
* **Hardware-Offloaded Visuals:** The specific character being played flashes on the 7-segment display using a custom hardware counter.

## Modified & Created Files
I have organized the repository into `cpp` (Software) and `hdl` (Hardware) directories. Below are the key files I modified or created for this implementation.

### Software (/cpp)
* **`main.cpp`**: Contains the main application loop that handles UART reception and orchestrates the Morse playback.
* **`morse.cpp` / `morse.h`**: Custom class responsible for the Morse logic map (converting ASCII to Dits/Dahs) and controlling the DDFS core.
* **`sseg_core.cpp` / `sseg_core.h`**: Extended the original driver to support ASCII-to-7-Segment decoding and the custom "Flash" commands.
* **`ddfs_core.cpp` / `ddfs_core.h`**: Driver for setting the carrier frequency and envelope for the audio output.

### Hardware (/hdl)
* **`led_mux8.sv` (Major Modification):** Modified the multiplexing logic to include a ~7Hz counter. This allows the hardware to handle the visual "blinking" autonomously when triggered by software.
* **`chu_led_mux_core.sv`:** Modified the MMIO interface to accept the custom "Flash Address" command (Address 3) from the processor.

## Quick Start (Run without Compiling)
To test the project without regenerating the bitstream or Vitis application, I have included the final
